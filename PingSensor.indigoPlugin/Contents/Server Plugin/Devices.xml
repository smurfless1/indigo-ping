<!-- If your plugin defines device types, you can define them here.

	 Devices must specify their type (via the type attribute):

		relay (ON/OFF/STATUS)
		dimmer (ON/OFF/DIM/BRIGHTEN/SET BRIGHTNESS/STATUS)
		speedcontrol (ON/OFF/SET SPEED LEVEL/SET SPEED INDEX/INCREASE/DECREASE/STATUS)
		sensor (ON/OFF/STATUS)
		thermostat
		sprinkler
		custom

	 The first six inherit states, actions and events from Indigo. You can
	 also specify your own custom actions and additional states, if needed.

	 The Device examples below specifies the sensor types.
	 
	 Devices must also specify a unique typeID - so, for instance, if you define
	 2 sensor type devices then your plugin can distinguish between the two by
	 the typeID.
-->

<Devices>
	<!-- This device illustrates how a plugin can inherit Indigo's sensor
	device behavior including on/off and numerical value states and will
	support Indigo and Indigo Touch's native UI for sensor type devices.
	-->
	<Device type="sensor" id="pingType">
		<Name>Ping Up/Down Sensor</Name>
		<ConfigUI>
			<!-- The ConfigUI here is just an example of the type of device
			specific UI that might be needed. Here you might specify a text
			field for an IP address, a serial port popup, or other device
			specific options.
			-->
			<Field id="address" type="textfield" defaultValue="127.0.0.1">
				<Label>IP Address:</Label>
			</Field>
		</ConfigUI>
		<States>
			<!-- By default sensor type devices automatically inherit:

				onOffState state IF property SupportsOnState is True
				sensorValue state IF property SupportsSensorValue is True

			The plugin can specify additional custom states and custom
			actions (in Actions.xml) to modify custom states. As an example
			here, we define a new custom state, backlightBrightness, which
			is used to control the brightness of the backlit display of
			the module.
